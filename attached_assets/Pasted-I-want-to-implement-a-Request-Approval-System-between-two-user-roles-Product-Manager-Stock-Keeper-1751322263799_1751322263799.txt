I want to implement a Request Approval System between two user roles:

Product Manager

Stock Keeper

🔧 Tech Stack
Frontend:

React 18.3.1 + TypeScript

Vite

Wouter (routing)

TailwindCSS + Radix UI + Lucide Icons

React Hook Form + Zod

TanStack React Query

Framer Motion

Backend:

Node.js 20 + Express 4.21.2

TypeScript 5.8.3

Passport.js (local auth)

Express Session

Multer (file upload)

Database:

PostgreSQL 16 (via Replit DB)

Drizzle ORM 0.39.3

Drizzle Kit for schema/migrations

📦 New Feature: Inventory Request & Approval System
🧩 System Entities
InventoryRequest table:

id: UUID

request_type: enum → prepare_order, share_quota, receive_inventory

from_user_id → FK to user

to_user_id → FK to user (Stock Keeper or another PM)

status: pending | approved | denied

notes: optional text

created_at, updated_at: timestamps

InventoryRequestItem table:

id, request_id → FK

product_id → FK

quantity

InventoryRequestFile table:

id, request_id → FK

file_path

uploaded_at

🔒 Roles and Behavior
Product Manager can:

Create:

prepare_order → to stock keeper

share_quota → to another product manager → if approved, automatically create prepare_order to stock keeper

receive_inventory → to stock keeper

Upload Excel file (.xls, .xlsx) on request

Stock Keeper can:

View incoming requests

Approve/Deny requests with optional note

Restock or confirm received items manually

🌐 Backend API Routes to Implement
POST /api/requests → Create request (with items + optional file)

GET /api/requests → Get all requests (with role-based filtering)

GET /api/requests/:id → Get request detail

POST /api/requests/:id/approve → Mark as approved

POST /api/requests/:id/deny → Mark as denied

POST /api/requests/:id/upload → Upload Excel file

💻 Frontend UI
Use React Query for data fetching

Create a form with:

Select request_type (enum)

Add multiple product items (product_id + quantity) dynamically

File upload field (Excel)

Select user to send to (dropdown of Product Managers / Stock Keepers)

Validate with Zod + React Hook Form

Show list of requests for the logged-in user (sent/received) with filtering

Approve/Deny actions (only available to recipients)

On approving a share_quota request, automatically trigger a follow-up prepare_order to Stock Keeper

📂 File Upload
Use Multer in backend

Store files in /uploads folder

Accept .xls, .xlsx only

Store file path in InventoryRequestFile table

✅ Start by:
Creating Drizzle schema + migration files for the three tables

Implementing Express routes and request validation using TypeScript

Adding React form + table components using Tailwind, Zod, React Query

Keep code modular and clean. Let me know if you need existing project structure reference.
